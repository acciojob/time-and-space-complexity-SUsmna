	<h1>Time and Space complixity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is understood as the time taken by a program to run and complete the given task. As a programmer, your goal shoud to reducethe time complexityof the code optimizzing it and make it more efficient.</p>
	
	<p><b>Space complexity</b>is a related to the amount of memory occupied by the program. For example , if a program takes an array of size n as input, the space complexity of the program becomes O(n).</p>
