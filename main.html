	<h1>Time and Space complixity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b>b is essentially a parallel concept to time complexity. If you need to create an array of size n, this will take O(n).</p>
